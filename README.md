Welcome! This is my personal portfolio where I showcase projects that I have created or participated in, with code snippets and images highlighting particular features I have contributed or worked on.
## Non-Game Jam-projects
### Backup
**Development period**: NOV '22 - JAN '23<br>
**Engine**: Unity<br>
**Genre**: 2D puzzle/platformer<br>
**Itch.io**: https://yrgo-game-creator.itch.io/backup<br>
<br>
![BackupTitle](/Assets/BackupTitle.png)
<br>
Backup was the first non-jam group project I worked on. It's a 2D platformer where you play as a robot hacking into a server. You continously create backups (checkpoints) of yourself that you can revert to at any time in order to bypass obstacles and get around hazards.
My main contributions to this project was the guard behavior, initial laser behavior, triggers and level transitions, and level design.<br>

### Doodlefall
**Development period**: JAN '23 - FEB '23<br>
**Engine**: Unity<br>
**Genre**: Mobile puzzle/platformer<br>
<br>
![DoodlefallTitle](/Assets/DoodlefallTitle.png)
<br>
Doodlefall was a solo mobile game project where I explored networking and database implementation in the form of a Firebase integration. It's a short puzzle game where you roll a ball down a board by tilting your phone. It utilizes the phone's built-in gyro to change the gravity of the game. It features profile creation and high score upload to a Firebase database. The title was originally meant to be a play on the title of the game Doodlejump, but I changed the style of the game early on and did not change the title.<br>

<br>
All Birds no Bees was a solo introductory Unreal game to get acquainted with developing in Unreal Engine. It is a 3D puzzle game where you place bird statues on pedestals according to provided rules of increasing difficulty. In this project, besides developing the puzzles, I spent a lot of time exploring different graphical features and playing with light and shadows.<br>

<br>
Bob the Brewer's Café was the first 3D group project I participated in. It's a café management simulator where you work in Bob's café to make boba tea for customers before they get angry and leave. You as the player are responsible for brewing and serving the tea as well as cleaning up dishes and collecting payment.<br>
My contributions to this project was the behaviour of the guests. I also did a significant revamp of the interaction system to make it more consistent what the player was interacting with.<br>

### HIGH MOON
**Development period**: SEP '23 - OCT '23<br>
**Engine**: Unity<br>
**Genre**: VR Shooting Range<br>
<br>
![HighmoonTitle](/Assets/HighmoonTitle.png)
<br>
HIGH MOON was my first foray into VR development. It's a shooting range style VR game that takes place in a graveyard where you shoot cardboard cutouts of monsters with your trusty revolver, Rolf. One of the key design ideas of the game was the focus on interactivity with the gun. Thus, you are supposed to hold the controller upside-down and in the wrong hand in order to use the trigger button as the hammer of the revolver. My contributions to this project where mainly the game loop and game rounds systems.<br>

My contributions to this project was mainly how, where and how often the weeds spawned and multiplied if they were left alone.<br>
