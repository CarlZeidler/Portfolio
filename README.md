# Carl Zeidler's Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal portfolio where I showcase projects that I have worked on, with code snippets and images highlighting particular features I have contributed or worked on.

Development period: NOV '22 - JAN '23<br>
Engine: Unity<br>
Genre: 2D puzzle/platformer<br>
Itch.io: <br>

Backup was the first non-jam group project I worked on. It's a 2D platformer where you play as a robor hacking into a server. You continously create backups (checkpoints) of yourself that you can revert to at any time in order to bypass obstacles and get around hazards.
My main contributions to this project was the guard behaviour, initial laser behavior, triggers and level transitions, and level design.<br>

## Doodlefall
Development period: JAN '23 - FEB '23<br>
Engine: Unity<br>
Genre: Mobile puzzle/platformer<br>
<br>

<br>
Doodlefall was a solo mobile game project where I explored networking and database implementation in the form of Firebase integration. It's a short puzzle game where you roll a ball down a board by tilting your phone. It utilizes the phone's built-in gyro to change the gravity of the game. It features profile creation and high score upload to a Firebase database. The title was originally meant to be a play on the title of the game Doodlejump, but I changed the style of the game early on and did not change the title.<br>

## All Birds no Bees
Development period: FEB '23 - MAR '23<br>
Engine: Unreal Engine 5.1 - Blueprints<br>
Genre: 3D puzzle<br>
<br>
//IMAGE<br>
<br>
All Birds no Bees was a solo introductory Unreal game to get acquainted with developing in Unreal Engine. It is a 3D puzzle game where you place bird statues on pedestals according to provided rules of increasing difficulty. In this project, besides developing the puzzles, I spent a lot of time exploring different graphical features and playing with light and shadows.<br>

## Bob the Brewer's Café
Development period: APR '23 - MAY '23<br>
Engine: Unity<br>
Genre: 3D café management sim<br>
<br>

<br>
Bob the Brewer's Café was the first 3D group project I participated in. It's a café management simulator where you work in Bob's café to make boba tea for customers before they get angry and leave. You as the player are responsible for brewing and serving the tea as well as cleaning up dishes and collecting payment.<br>
My contributions to this project was the behaviour of the guests. I also did a significant revamp of the interaction system to make it more consistent what the player was interacting with.<br>
